Permission sets are optionally used when we want to reduce the number of profiles that we've created and thereby reducing overhead
admin scenarioes.

For example: If a User, say, Dane has been assigned a marketing profile. She can read,edit records in account object but cannot delete it
Now Dane wants to have delete previldge, as a necessity. We cannot keep on creating a new profile just for the exception cases like the above.
For that, we have a solution called permission sets. Permission sets are those, where we can assign special permission to a User
say, delete permit to Dane though she is in marketing profile which does not have that obj level permission.

Through this, we give permit for Dane to delete records and also avoid create new profile just for her.
