Static variable:
Let's say the many objects are created for a class.
Every obj shares the value. The static var value can be changed only by accessing thro classname.
Only one copy of the var is available and that is shared among the objs.
Static var CANNOT be accessed thro obj.

Non-static variable:
Each object has its own value to the variable. This is non-static var.



public class staticExample2 {
	public String name;
   public static Integer value;
}

In the exec ananymous window:
staticExample2 s1 = new staticExample2();
staticExample2 s2 = new staticExample2();
s1.name = 'Raghav';
s2.name = 'Gaayu';
staticExample2.value = 3;
System.debug('s1 name '+s1.name);
System.debug('s2 name '+s2.name);
staticExample2.value++;
System.debug('Value is '+staticExample2.value);
