Role - 
The role hierarchy provides a framework to structure access to records and folders in your organization.Various settings (sharing rules, groups, folder sharing criteria, etc.) rely heavily on roles to structure access to content.


Related to hierarchy
Each user is assigned one role, which sets the foundation for their access to records and folders.

While a user’s profile and permission sets determine if a user can run reports, their role will influence which report folders they can access.

Grant Access Using Hierarchies

“Grant Access Using Hierarchies” is a setting for configuring organization-wide defaults (Setup –> Security Controls –> Sharing Settings).  For most standard objects, the option is always enabled.  For custom objects, it is enabled by default but can be disabled.

Users are granted full access (create, read, edit, delete) record-level permissions to the records meeting both criteria:

The record is owned by a user in a subordinate role.
The object has “Grant Access Using Hierarchies” enabled.

Example

Jim is assigned the role “VP, Northern American Sales”.
Bob is assigned the role “Director, Direct Sales”.
Org-wide default security for the account object is set to private.  No sharing rules or any other settings influencing record-level security have been configured.
Jim and Bob are both assigned to a profile that provides CRED (create, read, edit, delete) object-level permissions to the account object.
Result

What access does Jim have to Bob’s account records?

What access does Bob have to Jim’s account records?

Ans: Jim can view, edit, and delete Bob’s account records.  Access to Bob’s records is provided by the role hierarchy, as Bob is in a subordinate role.
Bob cannot view Jim’s account records, as the org-wide default for account is private.  Jim’s records are not shared with Bob, as Jim is in a higher role.
