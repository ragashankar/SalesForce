Developer Edition (DE)

Developer Edition is similar in functionality to Enterprise Editions listed below (but has much lower storage), 
and include a limited number of a variety of licenses (Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Community, etc.).  
These accounts are used exclusively for testing and development, and are provided for free by Salesforce to encourage 
the community to build and test on the platform.  They cannot be converted to any other edition and do not expire.

Force.com Editions

Force.com licenses can grant users access to custom objects and applications at a much lower price than
Sales or Service Cloud licenses – however, access to CRM objects is limited.

Mixing and Matching Licensing

You can mix and match only licenses of the same edition within a single org for Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Force.com editions.

For instance, I could add Professional Edition Service Cloud licenses to an org with existing Professional Edition Sales Cloud licenses.  
However, I could not add Enterprise Edition Service Cloud licenses to an existing org with Professional Edition Sales Cloud licenses.

It is often possible to purchase specific features of other editions, rather than upgrading outright. 
For example, workflow rules are available in Professional Edition for an additional cost.
