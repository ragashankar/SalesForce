Note: First of all, Salesforce.com is built on the Force.com platform - they are more or less interchangeable from a technical standpoint.
It's a mere matter of marketing semantics.  Force.com applies to the infrastructure and codebase that is the foundation 
for the entire Salesforce solution.  They are enforcing the Force.com concept more so because 
Salesforce can do so much more than CRM nowadays.

Secondly, regarding the functionality situation.  In this case I think you are referring to the Force.com Edition
in comparison to the standard Salesforce.com Editions (Professional, Enterprise, etc.).  In this case, yes there is a difference.
The Force.com Edition (or Platform Edition, depending on the marketing materials you have in hand, what day of the week it is and
whether or not your sneakers have green stripes) is a standard Enterprise Edition (if you buy in conjunction with a full Enterprise Edition) 
minus the CRM functionality - so no Leads, Opportunities, etc. (as far as I know).  This Platform Edition is aimed at providing customers
with the "platform" on which to build custom applications - for companies that do not so much use Salesforce for the CRM.

Force.com Liscense:
Salesforce platform : Users can access custom apps (incl. AppExchange) but not standard CRM functionality (forecasts, opportunities). 
In addition can use core platform functionality (Accounts, contacts, reports, dashboards, documents and custom tabs) 
Users with this license can only view dashboards if the running user also has the same license.

Force.com - one app: Users can access one custom app but not standard CRM functionality. Read only on Accounts and Contacts objects. Users with this
license can only view dashboards if the running user also has the same license
