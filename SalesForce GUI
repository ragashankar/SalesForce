GUI:
Page layouts:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
User Interface uses: (For Page layouts in objects (acc,opp..))
1. For field placements in a record (whether we want ph number to be visible at the top or btm)
2. For making a field required or invisible
3. For making a related list (child records) as visible/invisible.

Page layout can be done for each record in an object. Page layouts are for objects.
Setup - > customize -> obj name(eg:acc)- >Cust fields on obj(acc) page -> Edit obj(acc) layout
1. Can move the fields anywhere to be placed
2. Can make a field required/read-only by an option provided at the right corner when we hover around the field
3. Can make related list move up and down based on customer priority, can also remove a child rec.
4. Can add more fields in child records like fax number...

In Setup -> Home page (Home obj) :
Can see my name, chat tab(we can post, file,new event..),create new button(to create account,event,task,lead etc.. Most company disable this)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Study all User Interface options and checkboxes and their usage
---------------------------------------------------------------------
User Interface settings:
A. Enable collapsable sections: Lts users collapse or expand sections on their record detail pages  by using arrow icon next to the 
section heading 

B. Show Quick create : In accounts, contacts,oppor,leads etc. a record can be quickly created with minimal info. 
We can also create a new record in lookup dialog by chcking the show quick create button in UI. Many orgs disable it to reduce
too much incomplete records and push users to search for already exisitng records before creating a duplicate record.

C. Enable Hover details : When I hover over a link in recent items in home tab or lookup page, i can get details that appear automatically
showing some info about that link without clicking the link. Uncheck if not needed.

D.  Enable Related List Hover Links :  When u go to a record detail, u usually see the related list hover links on the top of the record
example: Permission set assignments, login history etc.. (like a quick link to go to that part of the page). Unchekc if u dont need it

E. Enable Separate Loading of Related Lists : First the record details are loaded followed by separate loading of related list at the top page
of the rec detail. Its for improving performance.

F. Enable separate loading of related lists of external objs : First loads rec details followed by loading of related list of ext objs
that are not in salesforce objs.

G. Enable Inline Editing : In a record detail, we can edit directly without clicking edit button everytime when we want to update record info
  Displayed by a 'pencil' mark on the right of every rec detail.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This doesn't enable inline editing for profiles. Inline editing isn't available
for accessibility mode, system fields, formula fields, case assignments, case email notifications, lead
assignments, setup pages, on records for which you have read-only access, dashboards, documents,
pricebooks, on records for which you have read-only access, All fields in Tasks except for Subject and
Comment, All fields in Events except for Subject, Description, and Location, Full name fields of Person
Accounts, Contacts, and Leads. However, their component fields are editable, for example, First Name and
Last Name.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H. Enable Enhanced lists : Enhanced lists give you the ability to quickly view, customize, and edit list data to speed up your
daily productivity. When enabled with the Enable Inline Editing setting, users can also edit records directly from the list, 
without navigating away from the page. This option is enabled by default. We can select multiple entries in list and edit them at same time
