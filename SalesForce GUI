GUI:
Page layouts:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
User Interface uses: (For Page layouts in objects (acc,opp..))
1. For field placements in a record (whether we want ph number to be visible at the top or btm)
2. For making a field required or invisible
3. For making a related list (child records) as visible/invisible.

Page layout can be done for each record in an object. Page layouts are for objects.
Setup - > customize -> obj name(eg:acc)- >Cust fields on obj(acc) page -> Edit obj(acc) layout
1. Can move the fields anywhere to be placed
2. Can make a field required/read-only by an option provided at the right corner when we hover around the field
3. Can make related list move up and down based on customer priority, can also remove a child rec.
4. Can add more fields in child records like fax number...

Multiple page layout:
If we have , say, sales team and Cust support team and each wants the account tab to be accessed at diffrent views, say, 
sales team want to view Name, contacts and cust supp team wants only name and case info, then multiple page layout must be done for
a single account object.
Setup - > customize -> obj name(eg:acc)- > 1. Acc(marketing) layout, 2.Acc(sales), 3. Acc(support) layout.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Study all User Interface options and checkboxes and their usage
---------------------------------------------------------------------
User Interface settings:
A. Enable collapsable sections: Lts users collapse or expand sections on their record detail pages  by using arrow icon next to the 
section heading 

B. Show Quick create : In accounts, contacts,oppor,leads etc. a record can be quickly created with minimal info. 
We can also create a new record in lookup dialog by chcking the show quick create button in UI. Many orgs disable it to reduce
too much incomplete records and push users to search for already exisitng records before creating a duplicate record.

C. Enable Hover details : When I hover over a link in recent items in home tab or lookup page, i can get details that appear automatically
showing some info about that link without clicking the link. Uncheck if not needed.

D.  Enable Related List Hover Links :  When u go to a record detail, u usually see the related list hover links on the top of the record
example: Permission set assignments, login history etc.. (like a quick link to go to that part of the page). Unchekc if u dont need it

E. Enable Separate Loading of Related Lists : First the record details are loaded followed by separate loading of related list at the top page
of the rec detail. Its for improving performance.

F. Enable separate loading of related lists of external objs : First loads rec details followed by loading of related list of ext objs
that are not in salesforce objs.

G. Enable Inline Editing : In a record detail, we can edit directly without clicking edit button everytime when we want to update record info
  Displayed by a 'pencil' mark on the right of every rec detail.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This doesn't enable inline editing for profiles. Inline editing isn't available
for accessibility mode, system fields, formula fields, case assignments, case email notifications, lead
assignments, setup pages, on records for which you have read-only access, dashboards, documents,
pricebooks, on records for which you have read-only access, All fields in Tasks except for Subject and
Comment, All fields in Events except for Subject, Description, and Location, Full name fields of Person
Accounts, Contacts, and Leads. However, their component fields are editable, for example, First Name and
Last Name.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H. Enable Enhanced lists : Enhanced lists give you the ability to quickly view, customize, and edit list data to speed up your
daily productivity. When enabled with the Enable Inline Editing setting, users can also edit records directly from the list, 
without navigating away from the page. This option is enabled by default. We can select multiple entries in list and edit them at same time

I. Enable the Salesforce Classic 2010 User Interface Theme : This option is not related to Lightning Experience. 
In this case, “Salesforce Classic 2010 user interface theme” refers to the newer version of Salesforce Classic, 
which is the interface that immediately precedes Lightning Experience. Enabling this option turns on the
updated Salesforce Classic look and feel. Disabling it turns on the 
Salesforce Classic 2005 user interface theme —the classic, classic Salesforce interface.

J. Enable Tab bar organizer: Checking this, puts tabs that are displayed out of screen under drop down list. Unchecking this, adds tabs
with horizontal scrolling of the page. Does not work with partner/customer portal. Available to Salesforce Classic 2010 user interface theme.
Cannot be used in Internet Explorer 6.

K. Enable printable view list : Go to any tab, say, acc tab, click to view all accounts, u get a list, there is a print option on the right 
corner of the list. U can take a printout of all the acc details. Uncheck this box, if u dont want to see the print option
