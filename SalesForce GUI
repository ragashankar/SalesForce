Setup link on top right corner:
Some org have a setup in top right corner, others have it under our name in top right. How to control these changes?
A: Setup - > Customize -> User Interface  - > Enable Improved Setup User Interface (Uncheck if u don't want to have a separate setup link
on the top right and instead have it under ur name in the top right screen)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Study all User Interface options and checkboxes and their usage
---------------------------------------------------------------------
User Interface settings:
A. Enable collapsable sections: Lts users collapse or expand sections on their record detail pages  by using arrow icon next to the 
section heading 

B. Show Quick create : In accounts, contacts,oppor,leads etc. a record can be quickly created with minimal info. 
We can also create a new record in lookup dialog by chcking the show quick create button in UI. Many orgs disable it to reduce
too much incomplete records and push users to search for already exisitng records before creating a duplicate record.

C. Enable Hover details : When I hover over a link in recent items in home tab or lookup page, i can get details that appear automatically
showing some info about that link without clicking the link. Uncheck if not needed.

D.  Enable Related List Hover Links :  When u go to a record detail, u usually see the related list hover links on the top of the record
example: Permission set assignments, login history etc.. (like a quick link to go to that part of the page). Unchekc if u dont need it

E. Enable Separate Loading of Related Lists : First the record details are loaded followed by separate loading of related list at the top page
of the rec detail. Its for improving performance.
