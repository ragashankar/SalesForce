public class staticExample {
    public static void method1(){
        System.debug('I am a static method');
    }
    public void method2(){                                  // creating a non-static method (static keyword not mentioned)
        System.debug('I am a non-static method');
    }
}
In the Execute Anonymous block, type the following:
staticExample.method1(); // Since method1 is static, its directly called with the classname
staticExample s=new staticExample(); 
s.method2();              // Since method2 is non-static, an obj is created for the class and the method is called thro that object.

Wrong code:
staticExample.method2(); // Displays error that Method is not available.
